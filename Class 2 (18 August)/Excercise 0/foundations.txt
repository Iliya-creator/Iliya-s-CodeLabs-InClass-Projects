What are data types?
The types of information that one can work with in JS. You get complex (i.e. non-primitive data types) 
data types that are composed of more simple data types, which are called primitives. Examples of 
primitives include strings and numbers and examples of non-primitives are objects and arrays.

What are operators used for?
Operators are used to do operations on data types. You get mathematical operators like addition and 
subtraction and then Boolean operators, which are for example greater than, less than and strict equals, 
and non-strict equals. 

What are conditional statements?
Conditional statements are statements that only execute based on the truth value of a test statement. 
First, the conditions are tested, and then if they are found to be true, the consequent block of code 
executes.

What are loops?
Loops are blocks of code that are executed a number of times, over and over until conditions for termination are met. You get different types of 
loops, however they all work in a similar fashion.
